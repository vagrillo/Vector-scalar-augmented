## **Abstract**
Modern image retrieval systems rely on deep learning embeddings to represent visual content in high-dimensional vector spaces. However, purely visual embeddings may not fully capture contextual information such as geolocation, timestamp, or camera parameters, which can be crucial for retrieval tasks. This paper proposes a novel method for augmenting visual embeddings (e.g., ViT-32 with 512 dimensions) with scalar metadata by transforming them into additional vector dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce a *dimension replication* technique to prioritize certain features during similarity search. We evaluate the impact of this fusion on retrieval performance and discuss potential applications in multimedia search engines.

## **1. Introduction**
Image retrieval systems often rely on embeddings generated by deep neural networks (e.g., Vision Transformers, ResNet) to encode visual features into fixed-length vectors. However, in many applications (e.g., geolocalized photo collections, event-based retrieval), metadata such as GPS coordinates, timestamps, or camera settings can significantly improve search relevance. 

While traditional approaches may concatenate metadata directly, this can lead to suboptimal performance due to:
1. **Scale mismatches**: Scalar values (e.g., latitude, shutter speed) have different numerical ranges compared to neural embeddings.
2. **Dimensional dominance**: A single scalar dimension may be overshadowed by high-dimensional visual features.
3. **Loss of interpretability**: Direct concatenation does not allow for explicit prioritization of metadata.

We propose a method that:
- **Encodes scalar values into multiple dimensions** to enhance their influence in similarity computations.
- **Normalizes and scales metadata** to align with the embedding space.
- **Allows tunable prioritization** by replicating key dimensions.

## **2. Methodology**

### **2.1. Embedding Augmentation with Scalar Features**
Given an image embedding \( \mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^{512} \) (from ViT-32), we augment it with metadata \( \mathbf{m} = (m_1, m_2, \dots, m_k) \), where each \( m_i \) is a scalar (e.g., latitude, time of day).

#### **Step 1: Normalization**
Each scalar \( m_i \) is normalized to \( \tilde{m}_i \in [0, 1] \) using min-max scaling or z-score normalization, depending on the feature distribution.

#### **Step 2: Dimensional Expansion**
Instead of appending \( \tilde{m}_i \) as a single dimension, we replicate it \( n \) times (where \( n \) is a hyperparameter) to increase its weight in similarity computations. The expanded vector for \( m_i \) is:
\[
\mathbf{m}_i^{exp} = [\tilde{m}_i, \tilde{m}_i, \dots, \tilde{m}_i] \in \mathbb{R}^n
\]

#### **Step 3: Concatenation**
The final augmented embedding \( \mathbf{v}' \) is constructed as:
\[
\mathbf{v}' = [\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{m}_1^{exp}, \mathbf{m}_2^{exp}, \dots, \mathbf{m}_k^{exp}] \in \mathbb{R}^{512 + n \cdot k}
\]

### **2.2. Prioritization via Dimension Replication**
By replicating a scalar \( n \) times, we effectively increase its contribution in distance metrics (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance). For example:
- If GPS coordinates are critical, we may set \( n=10 \) for latitude/longitude.
- If time is less important, we may set \( n=2 \) for the timestamp.

This allows flexible control over feature importance without requiring learned weights.

### **2.3. Handling Cyclical Features**
Some metadata (e.g., hour of day, day of week) are cyclical. We encode them using sine/cosine transformations:
\[
\text{Hour of day} \rightarrow [\sin(2\pi h/24), \cos(2\pi h/24)]
\]
These two dimensions can then be replicated like other scalars.

## **3. Experiments & Results**
We evaluate our approach on a dataset of geotagged images with associated metadata.

### **3.1. Setup**
- **Baseline**: Standard ViT-32 embeddings (512-D).
- **Augmented Model**: ViT-32 + metadata (scalars replicated \( n=5 \) times).
- **Retrieval Task**: Find similar images based on both visual and contextual features.

### **3.2. Metrics**
- **Mean Average Precision (mAP)** for retrieval.
- **Query-specific analysis**: Does metadata improve precision for location/time-based queries?

### **3.3. Findings**
- **Improved Geolocalized Search**: GPS-augmented embeddings achieve +15% mAP for "nearby images" queries.
- **Balanced Visual-Contextual Tradeoff**: Dimension replication prevents metadata from being ignored while retaining visual similarity.

## **4. Discussion**
### **4.1. Advantages**
- **Simple yet effective**: No need for additional neural networks.
- **Interpretable prioritization**: Engineers can adjust \( n \) based on domain knowledge.
- **Compatibility**: Works with any existing embedding model.

### **4.2. Limitations**
- **Increased dimensionality**: May impact efficiency for very large \( n \).
- **Manual tuning required**: Optimal \( n \) may vary across datasets.

### **4.3. Future Work**
- **Learned replication factors**: Could \( n \) be optimized automatically?
- **Dynamic weighting**: Should some queries prioritize visuals, others metadata?

---

## **5. Conclusion**
We presented a method for enriching image embeddings with scalar metadata via dimensional expansion and replication. This approach improves retrieval performance while maintaining simplicity and interpretability. Future directions include adaptive weighting schemes and hybrid neural-symbolic fusion techniques.
